Radiologists are requesting to have the ability to enter information in a Google Forms format that can be stored as FHIR json objects, 
and we would like to create a platform that replicates this form-style functionality while still being accessible from the web. 
Shiny Apps is an R package available for download from CRAN. It makes data manipulation and analysis simple in combination with a web application..
