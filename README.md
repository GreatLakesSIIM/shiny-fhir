#### Radiologists are requesting to have the ability to enter information in a Google Forms format

#### that can be stored as FHIR json objects, and we would like to create a platform that replicates

#### this form-style functionality while still being accessible from the web. Shiny Apps is an R 

#### package available for download from CRAN. It makes data manipulation and analysis simple

#### in combination with a web application.
